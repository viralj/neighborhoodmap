> Developed for Project 5-1 of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**. 🎓

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare. 🔰

Included is a list of my and my friends' favorite restaurants and hangouts in the South San Francisco Bay Area of California. 🍽 

I also included some local parks in the area. 🌳 🌲

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. 🗺

There's also extra info pulled from Foursquare where available. This includes websites and phone numbers. ☎️

The app is responsive, too! It resizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries. 

It can also recalibrate itself based on your screen size. Try resizing the window! 🖥 📲
